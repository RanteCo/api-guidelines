The Rante REST API Guidelines, as a design principle, encourages application developers to have resources accessible to them via a RESTful HTTP interface. To provide the smoothest possible experience for developers on platforms following the Rante REST API Guidelines, REST APIs SHOULD follow consistent design guidelines to make using them easy and intuitive.
